### You found me!

Hi! I'm Gonzalo (he/him), a (soon to be) software engineer (hopefully I'm finishing on 2021) that really wants to learn!

You won't really find something big here. Mostly I commit small project that I do while trying to try out new stuff.

What is my next goal? I don't really have one. If I have some time I want to experiment with react or Android but, who knows.

Either way, you can ping me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalogarciagranes/) (although you may come from there).

Have a nice day! üêª
