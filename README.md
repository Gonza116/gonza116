### You found me!

Hi! I'm Gonzalo (he/him), a software engineer with a bit of work experience (and every day, a bit more!)

You won't really find something big here. Mostly I commit for the company I'm working on right now (Qu√©Bueno!) and sometimes I'll do a small personal project. I need to find both time and ideas for those.

Anyway, you can ping me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalogarciagranes/) (although you may come from there).

Have a nice day! üêª
